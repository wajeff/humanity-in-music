# humanity-in-music

The Humanity in Music Project is a pro-bono charitable donation to Humanity in
Music and Jasmin Uglow. It is built using mostly vanilla Javascript and HTML as
well as Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. 

This project is upkept and improved constantly as my own web development skills
improve.

The next step will be to migrate the codebase into a React environment.
